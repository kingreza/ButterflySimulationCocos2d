Butterfly Simulation on Cocos2d v3 

This is an easy to use and easy to implement butterfly simulation. It uses basic cocos2d CCActions for animation and movement.

Butterfly movements take place on randomly generated bezier curves. 

Feel free to use it in your game or to change it around as you wish.
